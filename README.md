# React Application shows current Bitcoin's value

This project is built with **npx create-react-app**. Both projects will do the same, the difference between is how they are coded, one use compose to get the result, the other one does not.

To make the project runs, on both cases you have to get in the proper folder

```
get_current_value/
or
get_current_value_compose/
```

Once on that folder you have to run this command
```
yarn install
```
This will install all the dependencies of the project, and to run the project you have to use this command
```
yarn start
```
